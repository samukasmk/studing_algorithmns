# studing_algorithmns
The purpose of this repository is to be my notebook about my studies about algorithms and data structures,
showing and comparing different visions from many know books and good video courses.

As the objective is to have a space to store the temporary knowledge, with the fresh results of my
studies as quickly as possible, do not expect organization in the commits, or the absence of pull requests,
as the main idea is to centralize the information in a public place like the github cloud,
so that only after this big gathering of information I can compile learning slides
for lectures at events and things like that.
