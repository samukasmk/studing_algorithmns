# studing_algorithmns
The purpose of this repository is to be my studies notebooks about algorithms and data structures,
showing and comparing different visions from many know books and good video courses.

Respecting the main objective of keeping this space to store temporary knowledge about DSA, with the fresh
results of my studies as quickly as possible. Do not expect organization in the commits, or the absence of
pull requests.

As the main idea is to centralize the information in a public place like the github cloud,
so that only after this big gathering of information I'm compiling learning by slides
for lectures at events and things like that.
